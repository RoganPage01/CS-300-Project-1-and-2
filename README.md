What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem addressed in this project was to design an efficient data structure for ABCU's advising program, ensuring optimal performance in loading, retrieving, and sorting course data.
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of different data structures - vector, hash table, and tree - considering factors such as insertion, retrieval, and sorting efficiency. I provided a detailed analysis of each structure and recommended the hash table due to its balance of performance and simplicity, aligning with the program's requirements.
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Understanding data structures is crucial as they form the backbone of software applications. 
Proper selection and implementation of data structures can significantly impact the efficiency, scalability, and responsiveness of the program. By analyzing and comparing various data structures, I ensured the selection of the most suitable one for the advising program.
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
 During the project, I encountered challenges in balancing performance and simplicity while choosing the appropriate data structure. 
 However, through thorough analysis and consideration of the program's requirements, I overcame these challenges and arrived at a well-informed recommendation.
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project expanded my approach to software design by emphasizing the importance of data structure selection in achieving program objectives. 
It highlighted the need for comprehensive analysis and evaluation to make informed decisions, ensuring optimal performance and efficiency. 
Working on this project enhanced my ability to write maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs. Through careful consideration of data structures and their characteristics, I learned to design programs that are not only efficient but also easy to understand and maintain. This project emphasized the importance of clarity, modularity, and scalability in software development, influencing my approach to writing robust and maintainable code.
